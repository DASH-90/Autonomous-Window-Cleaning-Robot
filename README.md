## 🏗️ Technical Specifications & Mechanical Design
As the **Design Lead**, I developed the structural and functional architecture:
* **Adhesion System:** High-power suction system (~1000W) using a custom-engineered **Impeller** for secure vertical attachment.
* **Locomotion:** **Differential Drive** system with two **BLDC motors** and a **Timing Belt System** to ensure zero-slip movement on smooth surfaces.
* **Dimensions & Weight:** Optimized 50x45x15 cm frame weighing 8kg, balanced for stability and payload capacity.
* **Materials:** Hybrid construction using **Aluminum, Acrylic, and Plastic** for an optimal strength-to-weight ratio.
